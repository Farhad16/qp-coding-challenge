# Third Maximum Number

This function finds the third distinct maximum number in an array. If the third maximum doesn't exist, it returns the maximum number instead.

## Algorithm Overview

The solution uses a two-pass approach:

1. **First Pass**: Find the overall maximum and minimum values in the array
2. **Second Pass**: Identify the second and third maximum distinct values by comparing each number against the established bounds

## Code Analysis

**Source:** [414.ts](./414.ts)

```typescript
// Main function signature and key logic
function thirdMax(nums: number[]): number {
  // Two-pass approach implementation
  // Full code available in 414.ts
}
```

## Implementation Details

- **Variables**:
  - `firstMax`: Stores the maximum value (unchanged after first pass)
  - `secondMax`: Initially set to `min`, updated to the second largest distinct value
  - `thirdMax`: Initially set to `min`, updated to the third largest distinct value

- **Logic**:
  - If a number is between `secondMax` and `firstMax`, it becomes the new `secondMax`
  - If a number is between `thirdMax` and `secondMax`, it becomes the new `thirdMax`
  - If `thirdMax === secondMax` at the end, there's no distinct third maximum, so return `firstMax`

## Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity: **O(n)**

- First loop: O(n) to find max and min
- Second loop: O(n) to find second and third max
- Total: O(n) + O(n) = O(n)

### Space Complexity: **O(1)**

- Uses only a constant amount of extra space for variables (`max`, `min`, `firstMax`, `secondMax`, `thirdMax`)
- No additional data structures are used

## Example Usage

```typescript
thirdMax([3, 2, 1]); // Returns: 1 (third max exists)
thirdMax([1, 2]); // Returns: 2 (only two distinct numbers)
thirdMax([2, 2, 3, 1]); // Returns: 1 (third distinct max)
```

## Edge Cases Handled

- Arrays with fewer than 3 distinct elements
- Arrays with duplicate values
- Single element arrays

This implementation efficiently solves the third maximum problem with optimal time and space complexity.
